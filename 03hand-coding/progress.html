            <p>The lot has been staked, as have the two lots next to us! We are told that the foundation will be dug next week. They've also added a porta potty! Our yard will be small, but the <a href="https://www.utah.com/destinations/natural-areas/uinta-mountains/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Uintas</a> are right next door and the house will be <em>beautiful</em>, so we don't mind. Plus we'll have the neighborhood ponds and green space across the street. I am a little nervous about the sizes of the neighbors' houses, which go back farther than I thought was allowed, but we won't be able to see them from our back deck anyway.</p>
