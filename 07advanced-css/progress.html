            <p>The lot has been staked, as have the two lots next to us! We are told that the foundation will be dug next week. They've also added a porta potty! Our yard will be small, but the <a href="https://www.utah.com/destinations/natural-areas/uinta-mountains/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Uintas</a> are right next door and the house will be <em>beautiful</em>, so we don't mind. Plus we'll have the neighborhood ponds and green space across the street. I am a little nervous about the sizes of the neighbors' houses, which go back farther than I thought was allowed, but we won't be able to see them from our back deck anyway.</p>

            <p>Digging has begun on the two lots next to ours, and ours will be next! It will be interesting to see how the timeline will be impacted by them building three houses at once. Hopefully that speeds things up as the subs will have a long-term commitment. Can't wait to come up next week to see our hole!</p>

            <p>We drove up to the lot just as they were pouring our foundation! It was fun to get to experience that moment. Concrete going in the hole makes it all real.</p>

            <p>The foundation has been poured and the forms have been removed. Meet the footprint of our future home! Everything seemed so much smaller as I walked around than it will end up being in the end. The size of Ryan's shop, in particular, made me nervous. But we've done the math and know it will be as large as he needs it to be.</p>

            <p>Very little progress this week as they wait for the concrete to cure. The only additions I could see were the earthquake straps and the window wells.</p>
